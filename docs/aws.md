# Setting up an AWS account

If you don’t already have an Amazon Web Services account, the first step is to create one.  Go to [aws.amazon.com](https://aws.amazon.com/) and click the “Create an AWS account” button in the upper right corner.

You’ll provide a root email address and a name for the account. And then, you’ll be asked to verify your email. Then, you’ll enter a password, contact information and a payment method. You’ll also have to verify your phone number. Once you finish all that, you’ll be congratulated for your wherewithal.
