# Setting up an AWS account

The first step is to create an Amazon Web Services account, if you don't already have one. Go to [aws.amazon.com](https://aws.amazon.com/) and click the button that says "Create an AWS account" in the upper right corner.

You'll provide a root email address and a name for the account. And then you'll be asked to verify your email. Then you'll enter a password, contact information and a payment method. You'll also have to verify your phone number. Once that's completed, you'll be congratulated for your wherewithal.

Now you're ready to sign into the AWS Management Console, where you can access all of the services it offers.
