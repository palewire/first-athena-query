# First Athena Query

How to analyze hundreds of millions of records in seconds with Amazon Web Services and SQL

## What you will learn

We’ve all been there. Excel locks up. Your dataframe can’t hang. And that damn SQL query has been running for two days now.

There’s no way around it. The database you're working on is just too big for your laptop to handle.

This tutorial offers a solution: Amazon Athena. Follow along and you will learn how to rip through tens of millions of records with the power of SQL.

## Who can take it

This course is free. Previous experience working with Amazon Web Services and SQL will come in handy, but anyone with good attitude is qualified to take the class. You will be charged for the AWS resources you use, so a credit card is required.
