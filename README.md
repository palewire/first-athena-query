## Contributing

Start by making a fork of the repository. Then clone the forked repository to your local machine.

You can install the required dependencies with [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) by running the following command:

```bash
uv sync --all-extras
```

Start the documentation site's test server with the following command, which will enable live reloading in your browser:

```bash
cd docs && uv run make livehtml
```

You can now make changes to the documentation site in the `docs` folder and see the changes in real-time. You should commit your changes to a new branch and open a pull request to the main repository.
